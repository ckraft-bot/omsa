## Question 3.1
**Using the same data set (credit_card_data.txt or credit_card_data-headers.txt) as in Question 2.2, use the ksvm or kknn function to find a good classifier:**
  **(a)	using cross-validation (do this for the k-nearest-neighbors model; SVM is optional); and**
  **(b)	splitting the data into training, validation, and test data sets (pick either KNN or SVM; the other is optional).**
  
3.1a
It seems k=1 is the best with an accuracy of 81.50% which means a high bias as it prefers itself. But Looking at the ggplot we can see K=5 is the tipping point of the "elbow" graph for prediction power.

3.1b
In the lectures Dr. Sokol explained that data can be split randomly or in rotations. In this exercise I chose to randomly split my data (3 ways) because rotational data can be organized in such a way that may make the data have bias. The splitting can be 60-20-20 or 70-15-15, 80-10-10. I chose the 80-10-10 configuration. The best k still remains to be k=1. However the accuracy was decreased by a little compared to when the prediction was pitted against testing data in 3.1a. I even shuffled all indices for the train, validate, and test data to eliminate any potential biases. The better performance in 3.1a compared to 3.1b may be due to the test data being lucky [3]. I also wonder if the 20% split was halved making the pool of data to match against even smaller which could mean less likelyhood of matching which could mean lower accuracy.

## Question 4.1
**Describe a situation or problem from your job, everyday life, current events, etc., for which a clustering model would be appropriate. List some (up to 5) predictors that you might use.**

1. I have been tracking my spending habits for a few years now. I log monthly expenses such as rent/mortgage, insurance, utility bills, subscription fees, etc. on an excel sheet and create visualizations for myself to analyze. As of right now the clustering process is manual. It'd be neat if a cluster model can identify the purchase types by where the transactions were made without my intervention. 

2. Adult friendships are hard to initiate and maintain. Similar to the dating app concept, but for friendships, it'd be neat if there is a social networking app that links you and other young adults based on a few factors. The cluster model can group the app profiles by hobbies, geography, age, and (time) availability. 


### Question 4.2
**The iris data set iris.txt contains 150 data points, each with four predictor variables and one categorical response. The predictors are the width and length of the sepal and petal of flowers and the response is the type of flower. The data is available from the R library datasets and can be accessed with iris once the library is loaded. It is also available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ). The response values are only given to see how well a specific method performed and should not be used to build the model.**

**Use the R function kmeans to cluster the points as well as possible. Report the best combination of predictors, your suggested value of k, and how well your best clustering predicts flower type.**
